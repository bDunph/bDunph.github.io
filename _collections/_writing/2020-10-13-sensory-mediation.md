[Sensory Mediation: Searching for Equality in Audiovisual Composition](https://www.sonicscope.org/pub/mwc134uq/release/2) was published in the first issue of [Sonic Scope - New Approaches to Audiovisual Culture](https://www.sonicscope.org/). 

This paper looks at the practice of generative abstract audiovisual composition and identifies some areas of interest for the audiovisual composer. Abstract audiovisual composition is the act of creating a work of art that explores the interaction between non-representational visual and sonic stimuli. This form of composition has no codified compositional method or extensive vocabulary; however, there is much exciting work being done internationally to address this problem. As such, the aim of this paper is to contribute towards the evolution of an audiovisual vocabulary that will act as the foundation for further artistic practice.
