obj\_\#3 is an interactive audiovisual sculpture for VR. Place and presence, essential characteristics of the medium, are explored through focused interaction with an abstract audiovisual form. Visual and sonic textures react to the user's exploration of virtual space. Audiovisual correspondences are discovered as the user extends, rotates and moves their body around and through the sculpture.
