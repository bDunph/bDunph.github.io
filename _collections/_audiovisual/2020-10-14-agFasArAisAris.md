Ag Fás Ar Ais Arís (2020) is a generative abstract audiovisual composition that explores relationships between object, environment, texture and movement. The title is in Irish and can be translated as 'growing back again'. 

It focuses on a rotating fractal with mapped sound that is consumed by its environment before emerging again. The piece is intended as an exploration of how this type of object can be situated within the virtual environment and how the object and environment can interact. It is also concerned with the idea of foreground and background audio and visual elements and how they can interact. Finally, it also attempts to further explore the ideas of audiovisual equilibrium, isolated incoherence and cross-media complexity.

This fixed format video was recorded in real time and created with the [ImmersAV toolkit](https://github.com/bDunph/ImmersAV).
