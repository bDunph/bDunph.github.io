Performed live as part of the Immersive Pipeline Project at the SIML Space in Goldsmiths, University of London 2018.

This piece explores the binding of synthesised audio and abstract visual elements in the perception of the audioviewer within an immersive context. It continues the development of an approach to audiovisual composition using interactive machine learning techniques and based on the concepts of isolated incoherence, modal equilibrium and added-value exploitation. This compositional approach is here extended into an environment allowing for 360 degree projection and 12.2 surround sound which allows for the shared experience of powerful sensory material.
